		<h1>Spot</h1>
	<h3>The basis of the monster project series is to really hone in on Sophia's modeling skills gaining a more in depth knowledge of blender and z-brush. As she has never worked in these programs before. Spot himself is based off a worm with a few deviations to give him a more monster appearance. The series idea came to Sophia when watching Frozen with her cousin when the  scary ice monster named Snowball appeared on screen.  With harmless names like snowball, and sprinkles Sophia found humor in a person yelling out the ridiculous names of terrifying monsters. With a suggestion box posted online Sophia was able to get input on what to monsterfy next. The next creature in this series is a turtle named Jelly.
