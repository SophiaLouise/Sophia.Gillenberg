		<h1>Distanced</h1>
	<h3>“Distanced” was created at the start of the pandemic. The image itself is of a town in Italy that reminded Sophia of Catania, Sicily. Sophia was able to visit Catania one week before the pandemic started for her 18 birthday. This once in a lifetime experience was gone too soon and overshadowed by the beginning of lockdown. The image itself is a representation of that wonderful celebration/vacation fading creating distance from the treasured memory. The glitch itself was created using ImageGlitch to edit the images code line by line. Sophia glitched the image two times then put it into a collage to show the progression of how the image has become diluted and clouded as time progresses.
