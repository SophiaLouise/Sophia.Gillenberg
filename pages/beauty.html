		<h1>Beauty</h1>
	<h3>Beauty is a piece about body positivity and how the beauty standard has changed over time. Showing that you can not be defined by archaic and misogynistic standards. We as humans never stop changing, and come in all shapes and sizes. So having one size fits all standards for what and who is beauty does is not only completely wrong but damages the psyches of young women like Sophia herself. Sophia has battled with these brainwashing parasitic standards from a young age thinking that she was overweight causing her to develop an eating disorder. Constantly being shamed as a tenager in highschool by her peers made it hard for her to believe that she was perfect the way she was. Now Sophia, a more confident and powerful woman combats these standards by creating pieces like Beauty and speaking out at schools around San Diego as well as other volunteering opportunities. Allowing people to be true to themselves is more important than big business profiting off of an abusive ad campaign. This piece was created using GLSl which is based off of C in tandem with an image glitcher software. </h3>
