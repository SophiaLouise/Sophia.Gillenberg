	<h3>Flowers was a test run for beauty that Sophia liked a lot. The photo itself is of an arrangement that Sophia made at her stepmom's flower shop, specifically designing it for this project she used vibrant colors and interesting shaped flowers to grab the attention of the GlSI and image glitcher programs. Then importing the gif to photoshop fixing minor details and adding the reflection of the yellow rose on the reflective sticker along with other minor details such as saturation to the end of some of the more prominent petals.</h3>
