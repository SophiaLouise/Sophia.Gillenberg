		<h1>Relief</h1>
	<h3>In life Sophia often battles with high anxiety. These pieces represent a release of stress turning  a once negative emotion into something beautiful. Each line takes a worry away because through the stress and dysfunction lyes something beautiful that is uniquely yours. Just like how when they say when you worry you get worry lines on your face. These pieces were very difficult for Sophia to create because using ImageGlitch she went through the code of the image itself editing each line to create a reflection of the stress and anxiety almost personifying it. Then once each was to  her liking she transferred it to photoshop where she eliminated parts of the piece that was a bit off making it black and white finally adding a bit of shading to keep key features. Titles go as followed: Relief, Zen, and Mantra.</h3>
