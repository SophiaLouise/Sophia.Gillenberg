		<h1>Palace</h1>
	<h3>The palace was the first glitch piece Sophia created by editing the code of the image. The idea of the palace was created as an escape from everyday life, a mind palace of sorts. Each time Sophia visits it changes which is what drew her to use glitch art as her medium. The colors were chosen specifically to create the dream effect. Through trial and error Sophia was able to create her dreamscape. However with every dream you must wake up and for Sophia remembering the palace bits and pieces were distorted. The palace will never be complete only in time will it mature into a full complete work.</h3>
